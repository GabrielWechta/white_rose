The online classes will be held on MS Teams platform.

<br/><br/>I am going to finalize evaluation of all the lists <b>before</b> the last exercise classes,
<br/>because the last exercise classes on 09.02.2022 are reserved for the test (the test will take place in the Room 3, Building C-5, 7:30-9:00). 
<br/>Therefore on Monday, the 06.06.2022, between 17:00 and 19:00 I will be available on MS Teams
<br/>platform to finalize evaluation of the lists. 
<br/><br/>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
The final grade of a Student is composed of two parts:
<ul>
<li>Part A will contain the number of points for Student's answers to the final test questions.</li>
<li>Part B will contain the number of points gathered by the Student during the course of the exercises.</li>
</ul>
Each part is an opportunity to gather 100 points. The final score was calculated according to the formula:
<br/>
<br/>
<center><b>0,4*(Student's number of points from part A) + 0,6*(Student's number of points from part B).</b></center>


<br/>However, <b><font color="red">the test is not compulsory this year.</font></b>
<br/>Accordingly, this year two independent paths for passing the course are available, and each Student decides about the path selection:
<ul>
<li><b>Path.1:</b>
The Student decided not to take the test. Then I acknowledge that Student's knowledge of the subject is correctly reflected by the points gathered by the Student during the course of the exercises. Therefore formally, for Part A I set Student's number of points from part B, and the formula above for the final score is equivalent to:
<br/>
<br/>
<center><b>100%*(Student's number of points from part B)</b></center>
<br/>
Then Student's global score is translated to the grade according to the assignments below.</li>

<li><b>Path.2:</b>
The Student takes the test. By opening the test form the Student rejects the possibility of choosing Path.1. In such a case the usual rules apply.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Finally we have the following assignments:
<ul>
   <li>2 for the final score in the interval [0,40)</li>
   <li>3 for the final score in the interval [40,60)</li>
   <li>3+ for the final score in the interval [60,70)</li>
   <li>4 for the final score in the interval [70,80)</li>
   <li>4+ for the final score in the interval [80,90)</li>
   <li>5 for the final score in the interval [90,100]</li>
   <li>5+ for the global score > 100</li>
</ul>


<h4>The Test</h4>

<ul>
<li>The scope of the material for the test is the material presented during the lectures.</li>
<li>The maximum number of points for the test (Part A above) is 100 pts.</li>
<li>The opportunity to take the test will be available during the last exercises. That is on 09.06.2022, 7:30-9:00, Room 3, Building C-5</li>
</ul>

<h4>Lists of tasks:</h4>
<ul>
<li>If you could not present the solution during the deadline-class then, to preserve the deadline, please e-mail me the solution or the value.
<br/>of its hash (<b>I do not accept</b> logs provided by git and in general by any revision control system).
<br/>The solution you have e-mailed will be evaluated when we meet.</li>
<li>Any delay that is no longer than a week is counted as a week of delay.</li>
<li>The consequence for a week of delay is the loss of 50% of the maximum number of points from the list.</li>
<li>If more than one week of delay has passed then it is counted as two weeks of delay and it means that the score for that list is 0 pts.</li>
<li><font color="red">In one of the lists below one of the tasks is wrongly constructed. This is done on purpose.</font> For a report explaining what is overlooked in the task, and why exactly the expected solution behaves in such unexpected way you may score 20 additional points (beyond the 100-point pool). The deadline for the report is the same as for the original task.</li>
</ul>
The lists themselves:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://ki.pwr.edu.pl/kubiak/elliptic-curves/ecc-L1.pdf">List 1</a>, deadline: the <del>third</del> fourth exercises</li>   
<li><a href="http://ki.pwr.edu.pl/kubiak/elliptic-curves/ecc-L2.pdf">List 2</a> and the script <a href="http://ki.pwr.edu.pl/kubiak/elliptic-curves/ec-prime-order.sage">ec-prime-order.sage</a>, deadline: the <del>fifth</del> sixth exercises</li>
<li><a href="http://ki.pwr.edu.pl/kubiak/elliptic-curves/ecc-L3.pdf">List 3</a>, deadline: the eighth exercises</li>
<li><a href="http://ki.pwr.edu.pl/kubiak/elliptic-curves/ecc-L4.pdf">List 4</a>, deadline: the <del>tenth</del> eleventh exercises</li>
<li><a href="http://ki.pwr.edu.pl/kubiak/elliptic-curves/ecc-L5.pdf">List 5</a>, deadline: the twelfth exercises</li>
<li><a href="http://ki.pwr.edu.pl/kubiak/elliptic-curves/ecc-L6.pdf">List 6</a>, deadline: the fourteenth exercises</li>
</ol>
<font color="red">It is possible to solve the lists above by two-person teams.</font> For each list: the arithmetic average of the individual scores must not exceed the grade for the solution.


<br/><br/>Ladies and Gentlemen, those who, due to their health condition, disability or other objective reasons, may have special needs related to classes leading, crediting method or materials preparation are asked to report for consultations or after the classes, write such information in a private chat or write an e-mail about the matter. I will try to ensure that during my classes everyone has an equal right to gain knowledge and its' crediting.
