# 3. Will shorter working hours cause a decrease in unemployment?
British saying "work less and we all work" is back in style. Democratic Party in the USA even proposed a bill - 2327 stating 4 new propositions for fixing the situation with Covid-19 raising the unemployment rate:
- less costly open-ended contracts of up to 30 hours per week
- tax incentives for workers voluntarily taking part-time
- more part-time contracts in public administration
- tax penalties for overtime beyond a specific threshold
DP states that when fully operational these measures are estimated to get 750,000 more people into work per year

The rationale is: that instead of excluding people from the labour market, it is better to share out the working day. This would avoid peaks in overtime on the one hand and a lack of jobs on the other.

It is also important to notice what benefits to society shorter working hours will bring, mainly improving **mental health** and **wellbeing**. People will have more time. If someone can have satisfactory life with a 4-day per week income, he has one extra day for spending time the way he likes.

Yes, shorter working hours will cause a drop in unemployment.

# 5. Production automation will in the long term cause huge unemployment. Do you agree?
I feel like every few decades, predictions about the “end of work” are popping up and they’ve always been wrong. There was a spike in automation anxiety in the late 1920s and ‘30s when machines were starting to take over jobs on farms and in factories. Current evidence indicates that while in the short term technology often does displace jobs, it also creates many new jobs long-term, for example:
- design and maintain the technology
- whole industries build on creating the technology

It is important to notice that it is rather short-sighted to think that jobs will only diminish after implementing newer technologies. When companies can do more with less, they can expand for example: add new products or open new locations. So this will create new jobs.

The current technology shift mainly depends on IT. Programming is the same kind of skill that math or physics. It can be taught in schools and with varying approaches between abstraction and useability. I think that a new wave of fresh out of school programmers with knowledge enough to use computers efficiently for any task and create software for them is only a matter of time.

# 7. Will coronavirus cause an increase in unemployment in Poland? Discuss this problem. 
According to data from Polish National Statistic Institute: https://stat.gov.pl/obszary-tematyczne/rynek-pracy/bezrobocie-rejestrowane/stopa-bezrobocia-rejestrowanego-w-latach-1990-2022,4,1.html

The rate of unemployment did not raise during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Poland. From my perspective, I don't know anyone who has lost his job due to the pandemic shutdown. I found my job during the pandemic, and there were plenty of IT jobs offers. Also, it was discovered that there is no strong need for office space, which even might be allowed companies to hire more employees. 
I think the most impacted part of the economy was gastronomy, but thanks to the quick response of the government and apps like UberEats, Bolt and so on polish restaurants were saved.

On the other hand, according to https://gazeta.sgh.waw.pl/meritum/gospodarka-w-czasie-pandemii polish PKB has dropped significantly during the hardest shutdown. But things are looking good PGB is going back to normal values.
