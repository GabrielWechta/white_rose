# Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic

### Background

Germany suspended the gold standard when the IWW broke out. Unlike France, which imposed its first income tax to pay for the war, German Emperor Wilhelm II and the Reichstag decided unanimously to fund the war entirely by borrowing. The goverment beleived that after winning the war they will pay the debts. Main idead was to annex resource-rich industrial territory of the nearby countries.

Fortunetlly Germans did not win the war, what lead in *Treaty of Versailles* to 33 billion USD reparations debt, later revised to 26.3 billion USD.
