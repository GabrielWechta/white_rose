# Monetary and Fiscal polish policy

## Monetary Policy

Monetary Policy is implemented by the country's central bank to **control inflation**, **regulate interest rates**, and support the **efficient functioning of the banking system**. The Federal Reserve employs two different kinds of Monetary Policy.

- **_Expansionary_**: Central bank uses its tools to **stimulate the economy**. The general goal is to **increase money supply** and **ease taking credits** in hopes of boosting economic growth. 
  - _Example 1_: reduction of interest rates,
  - _Example 2_: reduction of reserve requirements.
- **Contractionary**: Central bank uses its tools to **curb the rate of monetary expansion** and **cool down an overheated economy**.
  - _Example 1_: increase of interest rates,
  - _Example 2_: increase of reserve requirements.

## Fiscal Policy

Main goal is to exercise Federal Government's power of taxation and spending to implement a Fiscal Policy that influences the economy by **maximizing employment** and maintaining **steady economic growth**.

- **Expansionary**: The government can aid the economy to recover or grow by **decreasing personal taxation which should lead to an increase in consumption**. A **decrease in corporate taxes should lead to increased investment and growth**. An **increase in government spending can create new jobs** or can even take the form of direct stimulus payments to those negatively affected by natural disasters or pandemics.

- **Contractionary**: Similarly, when the government wants to cool off excessively rapid growth, it can **increase taxes** or **decrease government spending programs**.

## Monetary Policy set-up in Poland
- Policy is set by the **Monetary Policy Council** and the principal policy instrument, is a **short-term interest rate**: the minimum yield on seven-day NBP money market bills.
- The main objective of the NBP is to **maintain price stability**.
- Since 1999, inflation targeting has been used. 
- From 2004, when Poland joined the European Union, the target has been for 2.5% annual inflation.
- A **corridor system** is used to control money market interest rates. The ceiling is given by the Lombard rate and the floor is given by the NBP deposit rate. 
- The NBP **uses required reserve ratios** to smooth the impact of fluctuations in banking sector liquidity.

 ## NBP Policy during the Covid pandemic
 - The **NBP responded quickly** at the start of the Covid pandemic. The Monetary Policy Council:
   -  **cut the policy rate** by 140 bps to 10 bps,
   -  instituted an **Asset Purchase Programme** (APP),
   -  instituted a **programme allowing banks to fund new loans to enterprises**. 
- Overall, the presence of the NBP had a calming effect with long bond yields declining despite the surge in crisis-related government borrowing.

## NBP Policy during Russian-Ukrainian war
- **Higher inflation and slowing investment** - The latest projection of the National Bank of Poland (NBP) assumes that in 2022, the average annual CPI inflation will be in the range of 9.3-12.2% with a 50% probability, compared to 5.1-6.5% in the November 2021 projection. In response to inflationary pressures, the National Bank of Poland is raising interest rates and announcing further increases. They are at their highest level since 2013. 
- **Rising food prices** - According to Polish experts, the effect of the war in Ukraine may be a strong and lasting increase in the prices of cereals and oilseeds, of which both Ukraine and Russia are major exporters. Their higher prices will in turn lead to higher feed prices and consequently to higher prices of animal products such as meat, dairy products, and eggs. The war in Ukraine through increased gas prices may lead to further increases in fertilizer prices.
- **1.7 million refugees from Ukraine in Poland** - A huge challenge for the Polish economy is the influx of refugees from Ukraine. Since the beginning of the war, 1.7 million of them have arrived in Poland (as of 14.03). Most of them are women and children.  An influx of another million Ukrainians is expected. So far, at least 1 million Ukrainians have already been gainfully employed in Poland. In turn, as a result of the beginning of the war, about 60 thousand Ukrainians – men who take part in military operations in their country – left Poland, which causes shortages in the Polish labor market.[xv]  – The influx of immigrants is a great challenge for our country, but it is also beneficial for the Polish economy, meaning an acceleration of economic growth and an increase in labor potential, NBP president Adam Glapiński believes.
- **“The Anti-Putin Shield”** - In response to the threats to the Polish related to the war in Ukraine, the Polish government announced the preparation of a package of stimulation of the Polish economy – the “anti-Putin shield”. It is to concern all spheres of economic life, which have suffered because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. According to government spokesman Piotr Müller, it will consist of economic, tax and financial solutions, as well as security solutions.  The government spokesman did not rule out that because of the war in Ukraine, the duration of tax cuts and excise duty on fuel and energy will be extended as part of the “anti-inflationary shield”.
- **Will Poland benefit?** - In view of the sanctions imposed on Russia, many Western companies are leaving the country. However, these companies are not slowing down and are launching their production elsewhere on an ad hoc basis. And this, according to experts, could be of great benefit to Poland
