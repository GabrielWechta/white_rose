I feel like this whole document is big set of definitions.

### Comment 1 Training
Training definition doesn't specify anything about periods of time that the training should take place. Also it does not state anything about some outised trainings.
 
### Comment 2 Detection
"Outside party" may notice ISO about incident, it may be red-herring
